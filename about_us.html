            <p>History of Key Club <br>
            The first Key Club formed in 1925 in Sacramento, California, with 11 charter members. This was the idea of two Sacramento Kiwanis Club members, Albert C. Olney and Frank C. Vincent, who also were high school administrators. They approached their Kiwanis club with the idea of starting a junior service club in the high school. It would resemble Kiwanis, have its own classifications based on school interests and hold luncheon meetings.</p>
